This document references Savage Worlds Adventure Edition (SWADE), SWADE Fantasy Companion (SWADE FC), and Warhammer Fantasy RPG 4e (WFRP4e). Provides guidelines for converting careers, mutations, spells, etc.

It is assumed that whoever is using this document knows about SWADE and WFRP.

As far as I know, there is a previous adaptation of Warhammer Fantasy for Savage Worlds done by [Punch Caster](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AOG0ho8ZrUGxtcDTSiOKqubXoF3YSCtDAgOig9BjzKI/edit#heading=h.x05n15293ici)

This document is not fully play-tested and English is not my native language.

## Character Creation

1. Roll for the [ancestry](#random-ancestry), and optionally roll for the birthplace.
2. Roll for the [career](#careers).
3. Pick 4 points of Hindrances as per in SWADE.
4. Distribute 5 points into the attributes.
5. Distribute 12 points into the skills, the following skills start at d4: Athletics, Common Knowledge\*, Notice\*, Persuasion, and Stealth\*. \* skills have specializations.
6. Derive stats, Pace, Parry, Toughness.
7. Pick Edge(s).
8. Buy Equipment from the SWADE FC. p47., treat the prices as silver shillings, each PC has starting funds of 200 ss. Conversion rate: 1 gold crown = 20 silver shillings = 240 brass pennies, 1ss = 12p.

## Setting Rules

### Mandatory Rules

- **Difficult Healing**, Fantasy Companion p.76. A caster can only try once to heal a particular Wound, and only if the wound is not older than 1 hour.
- **Dynamic Backlash**, SWADE p.138, a Critical Failure on a Spellcasting skill roll forces the player to roll on a special table with various chaotic results.
- **Hard Choices**, SWADE p.139, The GM’s characters only get Bennies when the heroes spend theirs.
- **No Power Points**, SWADE p.140, Those with arcane backgrounds don’t track Power Points but instead subtract half the listed Power Point cost (round up) from their skill roll to activate the ability. Powers may be maintained as desired at a −1 penalty to all further arcane skill rolls. Because of the **No Power Points**, the 4-5 result **Short Circuit** will inflict 2d6 damage to the caster.
- **Wound Cap**, SWADE p.142, Wild Cards never suffer more than four wounds from a single hit.
- **Corruption and Mutations**, see [Corruption and Mutations](#corruption-and-mutations)

### Optional Rules

The following settings rules are optional because they can make the game more fun, dynamic, or _Warhammery_, but can slow down the game with new players, so it is better to introduce them slowly and when players are already familiar with the game.

- **Betrayal**, Fantasy Companion p.76. Characters may not Soak Wounds caused by The Drop, nor may they spend Bennies to resist a Knockout Blow. Can help a game with deadly backstabbing and ambushes. Use it to increase the game deadliness.
- **Gritty Damage**, SWADE p.139. When Wild Cards take a wound, they roll on the Injury Table and apply the results. Can slow the game if each injury is rolled when in combat, my advice is to roll for the injuries after the combat ends. Use it to increase the game deadliness
- **High adventure**, SWADE p.139. Spend a Benny to gain the one-time use of a Combat Edge. Use only with Players who are already familiar with Savage Worlds, and who want more dynamic combat encounters.
- **Skill Specialization,** SWADE p.141. Characters choose a specialization for each skill and subtract 2 when using other variations. Helps to make PC more like in Warhammer RPG.
- **Fate Points**, see [below](#fate-points), SWADE is not as deadly as WFRP, use this setting rule in long campaigns if you want to lower the overall deadliness.

#### Fate Points

Player characters have a destiny. While their ultimate future is a mystery and there is no guarantee it will be glorious, heroic, or even pleasant, they are seemingly fated for something important.

To represent this, you begin to play with several Fate Points. Fate points mark you out from the rest of the denizens of the Old World. They allow you to survive against impossible odds and prevail where ordinary folk fail.

Your GM may grant you a Fate point for an act of extreme heroism, bravery, or significance. Normally, this only happens at the successful end of an important adventure, so make sure to spend them carefully as they rarely replenish.

##### Spending Fate

- **Die Another Day**: Instead of dying, your character is knocked out, left for dead, swept away by a river, or otherwise taken out of action; your character will survive, no matter the fatal incident’s circumstances, but takes no further part in the current encounter.
- **How Did That Miss?**: Your character completely avoids the incoming damage by some extraordinary fluke, such as slipping just as a blow is about to connect, a weapon mysteriously jamming, or an unexpected source of light blinding an opponent; your character can continue without penalty, but has no guarantee of survival in later rounds.

##### Starting Fate Points

| 1d10 | Dwarf | Elf | Halfling | Human |
| ---: | ----: | --: | -------: | ----: |
|  1-4 |     1 |   1 |        2 |     2 |
|  5-7 |     2 |   2 |        2 |     3 |
| 8-10 |     3 |   3 |        3 |     3 |

## Ancestries

### Random Ancestry

| 91–94 | Halfling   |
| 95–98 | Dwarf      |
|    99 | High Elf   |
|    00 | Wood Elf   |

Languages: All ancestries start with their native language and whatever other language(s) make sense in this background, e.g. A dwarf that has lived in the empire or travels frequently to it will speak and read Reiskpiel.

### Humans

- Adaptable(2): Humans begin with any Novice Edge of their choosing. They must meet its Requirements as usual.

#### Reiklander

- Languages: Reiskpiel

### Dwarves

- Language: Khazalid
- Tough(2): Dwarves are stout and tough. They start with a d6 Vigor instead of a d4. This increases the maximum Vigor to d12 + 1.
- Strong(2): Dwarves are stout and strong. They start with a d6 Strength instead of a d4. This increases maximum Strength to d12 + 1.
- Dark Vision (1): The species can see in the dark a short distance, ignoring all illumination penalties and up to 2 points of penalties from invisibility or similar powers within 10" (20 yards) distance.
- Reduced Pace(-1): Dwarves have short legs compared to most races. Decrease their Pace by 1 and their running die one die type.
- Racial Enemy(-1): Dwarves hated Elves since the War of Vengeance(a.k.a. War of the Beard). They suffer a –2 penalties to Persuasion rolls when dealing with elves.
- Hindrance(-1): Pick one between Greedy (Minor), Stubborn, or Vengeful (Minor).

### Elves

- Languages: Elthárin
- Agile(2): Elves are graceful and agile. They start with a d6 in Agility instead of a d4. This increases maximum Agility to d12 + 1.
- Intelligent(2): Elves are smart and witty. They start with a d6 in Smarts instead of a d4. This increases maximum Smarts to d12 + 1.
- Low Light Vision(1): Elven eyes amplify light. Other races often claim they can see stars in the elves’ eyes. They ignore penalties for Dim and Dark Illumination.
- All Thumbs(-1): Inherent dislike of mechanical objects, and thus have the All Thumbs Hindrance. They shun most mechanical items and designs.
- Hindrance(-2): Pick one between Arrogant (Major) or Overconfident (Major).

### Halflings

- Languages: Mootish
- Luck(2): Half-folk starts with one additional Benny per game session.
- Spirited(2): Half-folk are generally optimistic beings. They start with a d6 Spirit instead of a d4. This increases their maximum Spirit to d12 + 1.
- Reduced pace(-1): Decrease the character’s Pace by 1 and their running die one die type.
- Size −1(-1): Half-folk average only about four feet tall, reducing their Size (and therefore Toughness) by 1.

## Skills and Skill's Specializations

The following skills aren't used: Electronics, Gambling, Hacking, Psionic, Science, and Research.

The Gambling skill is folded in to a Common Knowledge specialization, for the rationale, please read the excellent [How-To: Skill Specialization](https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/311848/How-To-Skill-Specialization)

| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Albion          | The folk of Albion, who hail from a far-off mist-shrouded island-realm and are rarely encountered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Battle Tongue   | Warriors of the Old World. It is very common among soldiers and mercenaries and is used for giving orders swiftly during battle. It was supposedly developed by the goddess Myrmidia when she walked the Old World as a mortal.                                                                                                                      |
| Bretonnian      | The folk of Bretonnia, who are commonly encountered in the Reikland. Bretonnia is a chivalric realm to the south-west of the Empire.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Classical       | Human academics of all kinds. It is the first recorded Human language of the Old World — over 3,000 years old — used in most scholarly texts of the Empire, including wizard grimoires and many holy books.                                                                                                                                          |
| Elthárin        | The folk of Athel Loren, the Laurelorn, and visiting merchants from Ulthuan. Elthárin is the language of the Elves. The tonal language has many dialects, and is notoriously difficult for non-Elves to learn.                                                                                                                                       |
| Estalian        | The folk of Estalia, people of the hot, southern-western kingdoms known for their bitter politics and worship of the goddess Myrmidia.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Gospodarinyi    | The folk of Kislev, a hardy people from the frozen oblasts to the east of the Empire. The language is often called ‘Kislevarin’ or ‘Kislevite’ by outsiders.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Grumbarth       | Ogres; few others learn this simple tongue, though some mercenary commanders find it useful for communicating with any Ogres they may hire.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Khazalid        | The folk of Karaz Ankor, the Dwarf kingdoms in the mountains. This language is also wide-spread through the Cult of Sigmar, which venerates the strong relationship Sigmar had with the Dwarfs when he was mortal.                                                                                                                                   |
| Magick          | Wizards; a tonal language used to shape the Winds of Magic into material effects. The academic form of the language taught by the Colleges of Magic is called the Lingua Praestantia, which is quite different from the debased form of the language used by witches and the untrained. It is not a language used for communication.                 |
| Mootish         | The folk of the Mootland; i.e.: the Halfling grand province in the Empire. This language is little known outside the Moot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Norse           | The folk of Norsca. Norse is commonly spoken across the north of the Empire in Nordland and Ostland, and is well-known in the Wasteland and Kislev, too.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Reikspiel       | The folk of the Empire. Reikspiel is the primary language used in most WFRP games. It manifests in uncounted discrete dialects from across the Empire, most of which are mutually intelligible. It is the modern version of the tongue once spoken by the God-King Sigmar when he still walked as a mortal over two thousand five hundred years ago. |
| Queekish        | The folk of the Under-Empire. Used by the Skaven and their many slaves. Few admit to speaking it, or even being aware of its existence.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Tilean          | The folk of Tilea, who are most commonly encountered in the Empire as traders or mercenaries. The Tilean Princedoms to the south are notorious for their deadly politics and their veneration of Myrmidia.                                                                                                                                           |
| Thieve's Tongue | Street folk of the Old World. Expressions of this language are highly localised and individual to each realm; e.g. Tileans sport an entirely different ‘Thieve's Tongue’ to folk of the Empire.                                                                                                                                                      |
| Wastelander     | The rural folk of the Wasteland, a windswept territory to the west of the Reikland. The official language of the Wasteland’s capital, Marienburg, is Reikspiel, a reminder that the realm was once part of the Empire.                                                                                                                               |

## Corruption and Mutations

- Has two external sources, physical and spiritual. Physical is resisted with Vigor and spiritual with Spirit.
- There are also **dark deals**, the player voluntarily accepts a corruption point to re-roll any roll.

### Minor Exposure

These corrupting influences, although relatively trivial, remain dangerous for weaker souls.

If you fail the Check to resist the exposure, you gain 1 corruption point and 2 points if critically fail.

- Seeing a lesser demon.
- Having contact with a mutant, refined warp stone, or a Chaos-tainted artifact.
- Yielding to despair, fury, excess, or the need to change your luck.
- Being near warp stone.
- Prolonged exposure to Chaos worshipers, temples of Chaos cults, skaven, mutant lairs, and similar things.

### Moderate Exposure

Moderate corrupting influences are a danger to everyone and should be avoided under any circumstances.

If you fail the Check to resist the exposure, you gain 2 corruption points and 3 points if critically fail. With a Success you gain 1 point of Corruption, and with a Raise, you do not gain any corruption points.

- Seeing multiple demons.
- Having contact with a demon, warp stone, or a profane artifact.
- Embracing despair, fury, excess, or the desire to become someone new.
- Prolonged exposure to refined warp stone.
- Brief exposure to an environment imbued with Dhar, the dark magic used by necromancers and Chaos sorcerers.

### Major Exposure

If you find yourself faced with a major corrupting influence, run away. Stay too long, and you will never be the same again.

Checks are made at -2, if you fail the Check to resist the exposure, you gain 2 corruption points and 3 points if critically fail. With a Success you gain 1 point of Corruption, and with a raise you do not gain any corruption points.

- Seeing a greater demon.
- Having prolonged contact with a demon, warp stone, or profane artifact.
- Making a pact with a demon.
- Consuming refined warp stone.
- Prolonged exposure to an environment saturated with Dhar.

### Limits to corruption

- If you gain more corruption points than your Vigor plus your Spirit you have to make a Vigor roll or gain a mutation, with a success you manage to keep the mutation away but have to make a new check with every new corruption point gained.
- If a new mutation is gained, you lose a number of corruption points equal to your Spirit.
- If you accumulate more mutations than the greater value between your Vigor and your Spirit, you lose your character, and it becomes an NPC controlled by the GM.

### How to lose corruption points

1. "Naturally" by gaining more mutations.
2. Dark deals, you hear whispers from the ruinous powers that ask you to do a "small favor". If you accept, you lose a corruption point.
3. Absolution, you perform a MAJOR win against the ruinous powers, like eliminating a cult, and/or pledge your life to serve any of the gods that fight chaos.

The summoning is an opposed roll between the caster’s arcane skill and the Daemon’s Spirit. If the Daemon wins it may appear anyways but without any bound and can do as it pleases, additionally a critical failure means that a different rank unbound Daemon is summoned.

If the summoning is successful the caster gains control over the daemon but has to be precise in the instructions because the Daemon will follow the instructions as literally as possible looking for any loophole to do as it pleases.

All daemons have the [Daemon ability](#daemons)

### Fantasy Companion Domains

The SWADE Fantasy Companion (FC) assigns a group of powers to each one, the GM has to approve them because there are powers that don't make sense in Warhammer like _wish_ and _resurrection_.

Also, no god in the empire gives the power of _summon undead_ or _raise zombie_(s).

### Sin and Sin's points

Each God's Cult has Strictures (restrictions and mandates) a priest/cleric can gain 1 to 3 sin points every time that goes against them. A critical failure removes 1 sin point this can be interpreted as the goods punishing the user for their transgressions, doing Penance removes 1d4 sin points.

#### Wrath of the Gods

The following table substitutes the dynamic backlash from SWADE only for AB(Miracles) faith rolls. Also, the AB(Miracles) don't gain corruption from critical failure faith rolls.

| 1d10 + Sin points | Result                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

- 1 sc = 12 cp

### Stealth Penalties

### Weapons, Armor and Gear

Most (if not all) SWADE FC book Equipments are available with the same price with in Warhammer Silver Shillings. For example, a Great Axe costs 20 ss or 1 gc.

## Bestiary

I use a more succinct stat block format that allows me to prep and run games easily.

Example:

### Gor (succinct)

- P:6, T:7(1), Traits:d6/d8
- Axe: Str+d6

Means

- Parry: 6, Toughness: 7(1), has d6 in all traits and d8 in the best one(s).

I don't need a full stat block, and this format is straightforward to expand for an important NPC.

A fully expanded **Gor** stat block would be:

- **Attributes**: Agility d8, Smarts d4, Spirit d6, Strength d8, Vigor d8
- **Skills**: Athletics d8, Common Knowledge d4, Fighting d8, Notice d8, Persuasion d4, Stealth d4
- **Pace**: 6; **Parry**: 6; **Toughness**: 7 (1)
- **Hindrances**: Bloodthirsty
- **Edges**: None or Berserk if you want a nastier one
- **Gear**: Patchwork Armor (+1), Axe (Str+d6)

### Beastmens

#### Ungor

- P:5, T:5, Traits:d6/d8
- Spear: Str+d6

#### Gor

- P:6, T:7(1), Traits:d6/d8
- Axe: Str+d6

#### Bestigor

- P:6, T:8(2), Traits:d8
- Great Axe: Str+d8 AP 1

### Cultist

#### Mutant

- P:5, T:5, Traits:d6, Random Mutation(s)
- Spear: Str+d6

### Daemons

- **Daemon Ability**: The creature’s essence is raw magic, and unholy ichor pumps through what passes for its veins. Daemonic creatures do not require the normal prerequisites for life: food, water, air, etc. Add +2 to Toughness and Spirit rolls to recover from being Shaken, ignore 1 point of Wound penalties, and are **Hardy**.

## Careers Conversions (Optional)

> This is my opinion on how to do the conversion, you can do it as you see fit.

This is a tricky one, we have several options:

- Roll or pick a career from an official book.
  - Use the career as a narrative element but let the players assign the attributes and skills as they see fit.
  - Adapt it to SW, this needs to be done before the adventure starts.

### A Career as a narrative element

The career only serves as a background element when makes sense, there are edge cases like when the career is a wizard and the players wants to build a soldier, in this case maybe would be interesting to discover why.

### Adapting a Career

> this it is a lot of work with little payoff

| Trade                 | Professional Edge, Repair, Artificer Edge      |

In SW a PC has 5 points to distribute in attributes and 12 for the skills, the GM will spend 2 of the attributes and 5 of the skill points in what makes sense for the career, and the player can spend the rest in what they see fit. Also, WFRP skills that translate to an attribute will be ignored for the skill point assignment.

## Careers Edges

### Slayer Edge

> You are rage and shame incarnate, seeking a worthy death to reclaim your lost honor.

Is not mandatory that a Slayer picks this "Career Edge", but if you want a Slayer experience _a la_ Gotrek Gurnisson slap this set of edges and hindrances to your character

- Requirements: Dwarf
- Edges
  - Berserker: After being Shaken or Wounded, melee attacks must be Wild Attacks, +1 die type to Strength, +2 to Toughness, ignore one level of Wound penalties, and Critical Failure on Fighting roll hits a random target. Take Fatigue after every five consecutive rounds and may choose to end rage with Smarts roll –2. (SWADE p.38)
- Hindrances
  - Death Wish (Minor): The hero wants to die while completing some epic task. (SWADE p.23).
  - Shamed (Minor): The individual is haunted by some tragic event from their past. (SWADE p.27)
